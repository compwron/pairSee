Order cards worked with large durations by most recent date worked?

Fix --latest in SVN mode - it appears to be giving really incorrect "most recent commit of this pair"

How many cards has each dev worked on, total? (since given date)
How long has each dev been committing?
Total commits per person (this is a misleading metric)
